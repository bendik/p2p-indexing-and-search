## Building Append-Only Data Structures (Embedded Indexes)
* Can we add additional information to each block that will make our queries dramatically faster? Right now our blocks don't help "guide" the lookups in any way.
* In the previous exercises, your lookup algorithm did not consult the data inside your log at all -- it only relied on properties of the log (it's length).
* What kinds of additional information could you add to each block, to make your algorithm faster? Can the data inside each block tell you where to go next?

#### Takeaways
* This is what an __embedded index__ is -- it's foundational in our ecosystem.
* By embedding an index inside each block, you can reduce the number of lookups needed.
* This model can be extended to build a huge range of append-only data structures -- most modules in our ecosystem use on this pattern!

#### Exercises
* When appending new stats to your log, try saving the timestamp of the middle block alongside your data. Modify your query function to consult this additional timestamp.
* (Bonus) Save 4 timestamp indexes in each block to further reduce the number of necessary lookups.
