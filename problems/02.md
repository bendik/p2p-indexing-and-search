# Working With Append-Only Logs
Let's go ahead and get our feet wet with Hypercore and Hyperspace. Refer back to the [Welcome page](00.md) if you aren't comfortable with the idea of an append-only log.

In the following exercises, you'll create a few Hypercores and learn about the API by appending/getting some data.

## Exercises

Hyperspace exposes append-only logs through the corestore interface.

```js
const store = c.corestore()

// Feed is a hypercore instance, which is an append-only log
const feed = store.get({ name: 'exercise-03 '})

// Wait for internal state to load
await feed.ready()

console.log(feed) // Prints out details like the length of the log, byteLength, the public key etc.
```

#### Exercise 1

Run the above to see that you access a feed and print out info about it.
It should print something similar to

```js
{
  ...
  key: deadb...eef,
  peer: 0,
  length: 0,
  byteLength: 0,
}
```

#### Exercise 2

To interact with an append-only log there are four core concepts.

* Knowing what the public key of the log is so you can share it with other people.
* Appending a new block of data to the log (`feed.append`).
* Getting a block of data from an index (`feed.get`).
* Knowing how many blocks of data are in the log (`feed.length`).

To append a block of data the Hypercore feed exposes the append method.

```js
await feed.append('block #' + feed.length)
```

Append a block of data to the feed above.
Everytime you append you should see the `length` increase by one when printing it out.

#### Exercise 3

Now that we know how to append data and check how many blocks of data are in the feed,
make a for loop that prints out all the data in the feed.

You can use `block = await feed.get(index)` to get a specific block of data out.

Make a for loop that prints out each block of data from the feed.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < feed.length; i++) {
  // print the block stored at i
}
```

Notice that the `feed.get` api returns the block as a Node.js buffer.
If you want to turn that into a string you need to do `block.toString()` or do
`feed.get(index, { valueEncoding: 'utf-8' })`

If your solution works it should print something like:

```
block #0
block #1
block #2
...
```

Now that we have a better idea on how to interact with append-only logs locally we can [continue to problem 03](03.md)
