# Intro to Append-Only Logs
* Hypercore basics. Good text here.
* Introduce them to `get` and `append`.
* Anything built on append-only logs is versioned by default, and the Merkle tree makes it easy to replicate them with others.
* Trivially cacheable

#### Takeaways
* Hypercores have a minimal API (__`get` and `append` are the primary methods__.
* A Hypercore is __identified by its key__. This is a unique identifier.
* A Hypercore is __versioned by its length__.

## Exercises

Hyperspace exposes append-only logs through the corestore interface.

```js
const store = c.corestore()

// Feed is a hypercore instance, which is an append-only log
const feed = store.get({ name: 'exercise-03 '})

// Wait for internal state to load
await feed.ready()

console.log(feed) // Prints out details like the length of the log, byteLength, the public key etc.
```

#### Exercise 1

Try running the above to see that you access a feed.
It should print something similar to

```js
{
  ...
  peer: 0,
  length: 0,
  byteLength: 0,
}
```

#### Exercise 2

To interact with an append-only log there are three core concepts.

* Appending a new block of data to the log (`feed.append`).
* Getting a block of data from an index (`feed.get`).
* Knowing how many blocks of data are in the log (`feed.length`).

To append a block of data the Hypercore feed exposes the append method.

```js
await feed.append('block #' + feed.length)
```

Append a block of data to the feed above.
Everytime you append you should see the `length` increase by one when printing it out.

#### Exercise 3

Now that we know how to append data and check how many blocks of data are in the feed,
make a for loop that prints out all the data in the feed.

You can use `block = await feed.get(index)` to get a specific block of data out.

Make a for loop that prints out each block of data from the feed.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < feed.length; i++) {
  // print the block stored at i
}
```

Notice that the `feed.get` api returns the block as a Node.js buffer.
If you want to turn that into a string you need to do `block.toString()` or do
`feed.get(index, { valueEncoding: 'utf-8' })`

Now that we have a better idea on how to interact with append-only logs locally we can [continue to problem 03](03.md)
