## Querying with Hyperbee -- Simple Iteration
* So far, we've only talked about the `get` and `put` methods on KV-stores, both of which require you to know the exact key up front. These are nice, but often you'll want to do more sophisticated searches over larger ranges of values. As an example, in the previous exercises you might have wanted to find all stats between two timestamps.
* KV-stores usually support a "range query" interface that allows you to find all values between two keys in a sorted fashion. Range queries are super powerful -- in fact, the complex queries you run in modern database systems, like SQL, can be translated into a series of simple KV range queries.
* Hyperbee provides a range query interface through the `createReadStream` method, which takes a handful of options for defining the bounds of the query, and gives you a result stream back. Here's an example:

```
for await (const data of db.createReadStream(INSERT_OPTIONS_HERE)) {
    console.log(...)
}
```

#### Takeaways
* Range queries are super important.
* Hyperbee gives you a `createReadStream` method for this.

#### Exercises
* For these exercises, we'll use a database of dictionary entries. Here's a dictionary module you can use. First, construct a Hyperbee from the dictionary, creating KV-pairs of the form `word -> definition`.
* Next, use the `createReadStream` method to find all definitions between 'hello' and 'howdy'.
* Try playing around with the `limit` and `reverse` options.
* (Bonus) Use the `batch` method to speed up the insertion step.

#### Segue
* To take advantage of `createReadStream`s full power, you'll often need to format your keys in a specific way, so that they sort nicely. Let's dive into that.
