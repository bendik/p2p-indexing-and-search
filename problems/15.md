## Advanced IMDB Queries
* Kudos for making it this far!
* One of the secondary indexes we added to the remote IMDB dataset is a keyword index, `keyword!<word-in-lowercase>!id`. This index allows you to find entries by knowing a keyword of the title. For example querying for "keyword!game" will find you "Game of Thrones" and all other entries containing the keyword "Game".

#### Exercises
* Using the module sorted-intersect-stream, reduce two queries for keywords into a single result stream containing all IMDB entries with titles containing the intersection of both keywords (i.e. intersecting the "apollo" query with the "11" query should yield the "apollo 11" entry).
* There are tons of other fun query possibilities, but if you want them to be speedy, you'll need to add more indexes! Each entry contains title, rating, genres, runtime...with a few more indexes, you can efficiently answer queries like "Find the highest rated western".
