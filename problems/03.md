# Building on Raw Append-Only Logs -- Basics
* What can you build with just a log? A chat app, and live-streaming app. Share a few links.
* Here we'll start building a simple system for storing and querying process stats, like memory usage.

#### Takeaways
* Get comfortable working with Hypercore basics. Get used to the plumbing.

## Exercises

Use the [process-top module](https://github.com/mafintosh/process-to) to append a JSON object every 5s to our append-only log containing the latest CPU/memory stats
of our process.

You can install the [process-top module](https://github.com/mafintosh/process-to) from npm

```sh
npm install process-top
```

And you use it like this:

```js
const stats = require('process-top')() // instantiate a stats collector

console.log(stats.toJSON()) // get stats
```

Running the above prints an object similar to this:

```js
{
  timestamp: 2020-11-03T12:54:52.024Z, // when was this collected
  cpu: 0.021, // cpu used (between 0-1)
  memory: {
    percent: 0.0014, // how much memory do we use (between 0-1)
    rss: 24797184,
    total: 17179869184,
    heapPercent: 0.7238, // how much of the V8 memory heap are we using
    heapUsed: 4372752,
    heapTotal: 6041600,
    external: 1667491 // how many buffers/uint8arrays are we using
  },
  delay: 0, // how long was the event loop blocked
  runtime: 2 // how many ms has the collector been running
}
```

#### Exercise 1

Make a new feed, and append a stats collection every 5s to it.

Since we are gonna be storing structured data is is useful to make the feed automatically
stringify and parse JSON instead of Buffers. To do this we can use the valueEncoding option:

```js
// now get returns objects and append accepts objects
const feed = store.get({ name: 'stats-collector', valueEncoding: 'json' })
```

Whenever a block of data is appended to the feed the `append` event is fired.

```js
feed.on('append', function () {
  // a new block of data was appended
})
```

You can use the `setInterval` function to trigger an append of stats data every 5s.

To verify that the stats collector log works, print out and parse the latest block
of data in the append event and check that a new block is printed every 5s.

  <summary>Bonus Exercise</summary>

Try adding another setInterval to your program that uses a lot of CPU or allocates a lot of memory.
Check that our stats reflect that with the cpu value or external memory option going up.

You can use the for loop from the previous exercise to print out all stats from our feed.
