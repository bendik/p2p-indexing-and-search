# Building on Raw Append-Only Logs -- Basics
* What can you build with just a log? A chat app, and live-streaming app. Share a few links.
* Here we'll start building a simple system for storing and querying process stats, like memory usage.

#### Takeaways
* Get comfortable working with Hypercore basics. Get used to the plumbing.
* General flow for working with Hypercores: Get the last block, then go from there.

## Exercises

Use the [process-top module](https://github.com/mafintosh/process-to) to append a JSON object every 5s to our append-only log containing the latest CPU/memory stats
of our process.

You can install the [process-top module](https://github.com/mafintosh/process-to) from npm

```sh
npm install process-top
```

And you use it like this:

```js
const top = require('process-top')

const stats = top() // instantiate a stats collector
console.log(stats.toJSON()) // get stats
```

Running the above prints an object similar to this:

```js
{
  timestamp: 2020-11-03T12:54:52.024Z, // when was this collected
  cpu: 0.021, // cpu used (between 0-1)
  memory: {
    percent: 0.0014, // how much memory do we use (between 0-1)
    rss: 24797184,
    total: 17179869184,
    heapPercent: 0.7238, // how much of the V8 memory heap are we using
    heapUsed: 4372752,
    heapTotal: 6041600,
    external: 1667491 // how many buffers/uint8arrays are we using
  },
  delay: 0, // how long was the event loop blocked
  runtime: 2 // how many ms has the collector been running
}
```

#### Exercise 1
