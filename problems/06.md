## Query a Large Dataset (No Embedded Index)
Let's see how well your algorithm works on a really big dataset!

__Stats Hypercore Key: 309ba1736cc5af2940fc9fb03d256547b78ca9972ce4398648a7d7782d31ad4b__


We've been dumping a bunch of stats into a Hypercore with key
* Let's see how well your algorithm works on a really big dataset. We have a demo Hypercore that you can replicate for testing.
* Check out how many round-trips were necessary in order to complete the query. How many blocks have you downloaded? __We need a simple info function for this__

## Exercise

## Takeaways
Using the naive approach, the reader needs to download the entire log, even though they're only interested in one block. It works, but it's slow and bandwidth-intensive, especially on large datasets. On the plus side, after the query the reader has downloaded a complete replica of the log, which means the dataset will remain fully available if the writer goes offline.

But we can do a lot better by taking advantage of the fact that the data is time-ordered, or "indexed by time".
