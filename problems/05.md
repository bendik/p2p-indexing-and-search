## Building on Raw Append-Only Logs -- Querying
* Now we're going to expand on our stats collection system to allow readers to query for stats closest to a given timestamp.

#### Takeaways
* With the naive approach, we need to do a __full sync__ of the data, even though we're only interested in finding a single block.
* The data is implicitly indexed by time, and we should be able to make use of that to reduce the number of blocks we need to fetch.

#### Exercises
* Solve this problem naively by iterating over the complete log, looking for the closest value (first one >= the timestamp).
* Can we do better? Yes, bisecting.

#### Segue
* Let's try this out on a large dataset.
