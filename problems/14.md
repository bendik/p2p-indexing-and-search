## Querying a Real-World P2P Database (IMDB)
* We've inserted the [entire IMDB dataset](), along with a single secondary index (ratings), into a Hyperbee. The database key is __xxxxxxx__. If you've made it this far, it's time to apply what you've learned!
* The IMDB database contains two indexes, one for querying by IMDB ID, and one for querying by rating. The key encodings for these indexes are as follows:

```
ids!<id> -> metadata (example id is tt8760684, you can fine more searching imdb in the url bar)
ratings!lexint(10 * rating)!id -> id
keyword!<lower-case-keyword>!id -> id
```

#### Exercises
* Try running a few queries against our database. Take a look at how many blocks in the Hyperbee's underlying Hypercore are downloaded during each query. For inspiration, try finding the highest rated show of all time, then the lowest.
