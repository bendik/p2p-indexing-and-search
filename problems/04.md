## Building on Raw Append-Only Logs -- Replication
* Here we're going to share the stats we collected in the previous exercise with another reader.

#### Takeaways
* Get comfortable with swarming and the replication flow.
* Introduce __replication__. The last entry can be fetched from the network without loading historical data.
* There are two ways to replicate an append-only log: __sparse and eager__. With sparse replication, you only need to download the blocks you access locally.

#### Exercise
* Create a reader that swarms with the stats writer.
* Get the last entry and print it out.
* Query your collected stats -- "highest memory usage in the last hour". How can this be made faster?
* Write a recursive stats analyzer that starts at the latest, then bisects to answer simple questions.

#### Segue
* Getting the last value out isn't super useful -- you want to be able to run queries over the stats you've collected.
* So far, we're only making use of the latest block, but we could've just used an HTTP server for that! Since we're storing all historical data, we should be able to make use of that too.
