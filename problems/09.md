## Key/Value Stores (Text Only)
* Let's sum of what we've done so far. We have a peer-to-peer, distributed stats "database" that can find stats for a given timestamp from other peers. Since fetching blocks from the network is costly, we've added an embedded index that speeds up that query.
* In the database world, what we've built is a limited form of a "key/value store", or KV-store for short. So far, timestamps have been the "keys", and our stats have been the "values".
* In Javascript, a KV-store usually has a really simple interface: `put` and `get`:
```
val = db.get(key)
db.put(key, val)
```
* Our KV-store has a big limitation though: it only works with keys that are monotonically increasing, meaning any key that's inserted must be greater than the previous key. This works well for timestamps, because time has a great property: it's always increasing.
* Is there a simple way to make our database work with keys that aren't monotonically increasing? Yes and no.
* Most databases use a tried-and-true data structure called a B-Tree to solve this problem (to learn more, check out the links below), but constructing a B-Tree on top of an append-only log is tricky. Luckily for you, we've extended the embedded indexing technique you used in the previous exercises to build an append-only B-Tree called Hyperbee!
* Let's dive into Hyperbee and see how it can help us make useful databases for real-world data.
