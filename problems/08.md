# Querying a Large Dataset

Let's try again to use our solution from the previous exercise in practice.
We made a another large stats dataset available at the following public key:

```
ebcd9b99efb4ba8661076dd7e7a886cc5380a3f5998f16bfeeaaecfe0885de4a
```

# Exercise 1

Modify your reader from the previous exercise to query our remote dataset that implements the embedded index.

Query for the entry with the following timestamp `'2020-11-03T23:00:02.700Z'` and see that it finds it.

# Exercise 2

Try running it again. Is it slower or faster?
Use the download event on the core to track which new blocks are being downloaded as we query.

```js
core.on('download', function (index) {
  console.log('Downloaded this block: ' + index)
})
```

Try querying for different dates and see how it performs and how much data is downloaded.

[When you are done let's move on to using a generic Database that uses an embedded in Problem 9](09.md)
