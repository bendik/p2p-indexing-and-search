# Querying a Large Dataset

Let's try again to use our solution from the previous exercise in practice.
We're hosting another large stats Hypercore on our server, but this time the core includes the embedded index from the previous exercise:

The indexed Hypercore is available at the following key:
```
ebcd9b99efb4ba8661076dd7e7a886cc5380a3f5998f16bfeeaaecfe0885de4a
```

## Exercises

#### Exercise 1

Modify your reader from the previous exercise to query our remote dataset that implements the embedded index.

Query for the entry with the following timestamp `'2020-11-03T23:00:02.700Z'` and see that it finds it.

#### Exercise 2

Try running it again. Is it slower or faster?
Use the download event on the core to track which new blocks are being downloaded as we query.

```js
core.on('download', function (index) {
  console.log('Downloaded this block: ' + index)
})
```

Try querying for different dates and see how it performs and how much data is downloaded.

## Stuck?

Take a look at the [solution here](/solutions/08/index.js).

[When you are done let's move on to using a P2P database that uses an embedded index in Problem 9](09.md)
